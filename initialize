//jshint esversion: 6
//When starting a new project you will always be useing express and bodyParser
//Steps 1-2 are to Set up a new project
//1. Require the modules we installed ()
const requests = require('requests');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const express = require('express');


//2.Setup server to listen to port 3000 but first create our app constant
//2.a.the app constant is equal to a new instance of express
const app = express();
//4. in order for server to serve static pages like stylesheets and images on local files
//We need to use a special function of express call static
//make a static folder (to keep all static files) with goes in the parenthese of .static
app.use(express.static("public"));
//6. Lets log some of the things the user entered into the from
//6.a. Since bodyParser has already been required we can use it to get the data
//6.b. So tell the app to use bodyParser by saying app.user
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({extended:true}));
//3. set up the get method for our home route then test it on the home browser at host 3000
// specify the route - use the home route "/"
//Add callback function with req and res
app.get("/", function (req,res){
  //3.a. specify our response is to send the file at the location of the directory name of current file plus
  //3.b. the string signup.html
  res.sendFile(__dirname + "/signup.html");
});
//5. program the post route (create post route)
//5.a. by using body-parser to grab data from the sign up form
//5.b. then console log it from the server. first wetarget the home route "/"
app.post("/", function(req,res){
//7. Next pull the inputs from the form which were inputed
//7.a. creat a variable
//7.b. now pull up the values entered by referring to the name ="" set up in html by using bodyParser
//8. Must make sure the form is referred to as POST and the action is set up
//8.a. action = "/" and  method = "POST" So information gets posted to
// the location requested here "/"
var firstName = req.body.fname;
var lastName = req.body.lName;
var email = req.body.email;

console.log(firstName, lastName, email);
})

//2.b.use the app to listen on port 3000
//2.b.Once port is set up it notify by logging server is running
//2.b. visit local host 3000 to view site set up with server
app.listen(3000, function() {
  console.log("Server is running on port 3000");
});
